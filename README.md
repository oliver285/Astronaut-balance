To do tasks{

Apex calculation in arduino

Once load cell and encoder data is ready to read integrate with single motor torque set up script to output tether length and measured force 
determine force to torque relationship will be done in single motor test verify encoder data and tether length relationship(mathematically estimate both these relationships before testing)


full 3 motor script set up once single motor is verified
state switch implementation that can control the motor state from the computer





Script that adds on to ethans user interface
csv should save off tether lengths, mass error, applied force error , angle error
